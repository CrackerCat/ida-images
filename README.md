# ida-images
Image preview plugin for Ida disassembler.

## Application

I made this plugin to ease finding image decoding routines - I can run some
complex code and see if the memory contains the image I'm looking for
afterwards.

## Features

- CLI frontend for analyzing standalone files
- Multiple pixel formats to choose from: RGB, BGR, alpha channels, etc.
- Saving as PNG
- Adjusting brightness (useful for searching for images using palettes)
- Flipping vertically (useful for analyzing images using BMP-like layout)
- Convenient keyboard shortcuts:
    - <kbd>G</kbd> - go to address (supports input such as `edi`)
    - <kbd>Q</kbd> - close
    - <kbd>Ctrl+F</kbd> - toggle vertical flip
    - <kbd>H</kbd> - shrink size horizontally by 1 pixel
    - <kbd>J</kbd> - expand size vertically by 1 pixel
    - <kbd>K</kbd> - shrink size vertically by 1 pixel
    - <kbd>L</kbd> - expand size horizontally by 1 pixel
    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd> - shrink size horizontally by 25 pixels
    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>J</kbd> - expand size vertically by 25 pixels
    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> - shrink size vertically by 25 pixels
    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> - expand size horizontally by 25 pixels
    - <kbd>&larr;</kbd> - go backward by one byte
    - <kbd>&rarr;</kbd> - go forward by one byte
    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd> - go backward by 25 bytes
    - <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> - go forward by 25 bytes
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd> - go backward by 1/10 a "page"
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> - go forward by 1/10 a "page"
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&larr;</kbd> - go backward by one "page"
    - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> - go forward by one "page"

Additionally, I'm open to feature requests, as long as they won't make the code
too bloated.

## Installation

Either drop the `rgb-ida.py` file and `librgb` directory in `C:\Program Files
(x86)\IDA 6.6\plugins` (or similar) and then run it via
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>, or run the script manually with
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F9</kbd>. The other file, `./rgb`, is a CLI frontend that
can be used outside Ida and analyzes files rather than process memory.

## Seeing it in action

#### Viewing program code

I have no idea what the gradients are there for, but it's certainly
interesting!

More mysterious data.

Now all that's left is to localize the exact function that allocated this
segment... and voil√†.
